### QFolder
QFolder is "simple" program to pack directory into a `.qpack` file similar, but yet entirely different from `.tar` used in GNU.
### Compiling
1. Clone repo
2. Enter the folder
3. Run `dotnet build` or `dotnet run` (You will neet .NET6.0 or higher)
### Usage
This is a Demo. Currently it will pack `source` folder into `output.qpack` and unpack it back into `output` folder
Change `Program.cs` to change behavior
